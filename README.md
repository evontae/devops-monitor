# DevOps Monitor

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a robust and scalable system monitoring tool, deeply rooted in SRE/DevOps principles. Leveraging containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes/Helm), and cloud-native technologies on Azure (Functions, Monitor, Container Registry, Log Analytics, DevOps, Chaos Studio), the tool is designed to evolve continually, providing comprehensive insights into system health and performance. It prioritizes reliability, automation, continuous improvement, and proactive incident response, adapting to new challenges and technologies as they emerge.

The tool collects essential system metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network traffic, and potentially more), delivering real-time data for proactive issue detection and resolution. It embraces chaos engineering practices to uncover vulnerabilities and explores the potential of ML/AI for predictive analysis and anomaly detection, enhancing overall system reliability and security.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern DevOps practices, showcasing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) with Azure DevOps, and the effective use of Azure's cloud ecosystem for building and managing resilient systems.

## Plan & Deliverables

### Phase 1: Foundation and Local Deployment

#### Deliverable 1.1: Modularized System Monitor with Logging and Tests
- Break down `system_monitor.py` into modules (cpu, memory, disk, network) with clear functions and interfaces.
- Ensure modularity allows for easy addition of future monitoring capabilities.
- Implement structured logging in JSON format for easy parsing and analysis.
- Write unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and correctness.

#### Deliverable 1.2: Secure Dockerized Application
- Create a Dockerfile for the monitoring tool, using a minimal base image and layering dependencies efficiently.
- Implement image vulnerability scanning within the Docker build process to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
- Build and test the Docker image locally, verifying that the monitoring tool runs correctly within the containerized environment.
- Push the Docker image to a private container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry) for secure storage and controlled access.

#### Deliverable 1.3: Kubernetes Deployment and RBAC
- Set up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube or kind.
- Create Helm charts to define the deployment configuration for the monitoring tool, specifying resource requirements, replicas, and other relevant settings.
- Deploy the monitoring tool to the local Kubernetes cluster using Helm, ensuring proper configuration and communication between pods.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to manage user permissions and secure access to the monitoring tool and its resources.

### Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure and CI/CD

#### Deliverable 2.1: Terraform Configuration with Security and Cost Optimization
- Define the required Azure resources (AKS cluster, Container Registry, Log Analytics Workspace, Virtual Networks, Load Balancers) using Terraform modules.
- Employ infrastructure as code principles to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments.
- Implement security measures like network security groups, private endpoints, and encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Optimize costs by leveraging spot instances, reserved instances, and right-sizing resources based on workload demands.

#### Deliverable 2.2: Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Vulnerability Scanning
- Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle.
- Trigger builds on code commits, run automated tests (unit, integration), and perform image vulnerability scans to ensure code quality and security.
- Deploy the Dockerized monitoring tool to the AKS cluster using a rolling update or blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime upgrades.

#### Deliverable 2.3: Automated Deployment to AKS and Secrets Management
- Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the latest version of the monitoring tool to the AKS cluster upon successful build and testing.
- Securely manage secrets like database credentials and API keys using Azure Key Vault, preventing sensitive information from being exposed in configuration files or logs.

### Phase 3: Azure Functions and Observability

#### Deliverable 3.1: Azure Function Integration and Optimization
- Identify specific monitoring modules that can be offloaded to Azure Functions for event-driven processing.
- Refactor the selected modules into Azure Functions, leveraging triggers and bindings for efficient data ingestion and processing.
- Optimize Azure Functions for performance and cost-effectiveness by choosing the appropriate pricing tier and resource allocations.

#### Deliverable 3.2: Monitoring, Alerting, and Dashboarding
- Configure Azure Monitor to collect logs and metrics from the monitoring tool, Azure Functions, and the AKS cluster.
- Set up Prometheus to scrape additional metrics from the monitoring tool and its dependencies.
- Design and create informative Grafana dashboards that visualize metrics from both Azure Monitor and Prometheus.
- Implement alerting mechanisms based on predefined thresholds, anomaly detection, or custom rules.

### Phase 4: Incident Response and Chaos Engineering

#### Deliverable 4.1: Incident Response Playbook and Communication Plan
- Develop a comprehensive incident response playbook outlining detailed steps for handling different incident types (e.g., service outages, performance degradation, security breaches).
- Define roles and responsibilities for incident response team members.
- Establish communication channels (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty) and protocols for efficient incident alerts and collaboration.

#### Deliverable 4.2: Chaos Experiments and Resilience Testing
- Design a series of chaos experiments using Azure Chaos Studio to inject controlled failures into the system (e.g., simulate node failures, network latency, resource exhaustion).
- Conduct load testing to assess the system's performance and scalability under stress.
- Thoroughly analyze experiment results and load testing data to identify vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
- Implement fixes and optimizations based on findings to enhance system resilience and reliability.

### Phase 5 (Optional): ML/AI Integration

#### Deliverable 5.1: ML Model Development and Validation
- Gather and analyze historical metric data from the monitoring tool and Azure Monitor.
- Research and select appropriate ML algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, forecasting) for predictive analysis.
- Develop and train ML models using relevant libraries and frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
- Validate model performance using rigorous testing and evaluation methodologies.

#### Deliverable 5.2: ML Model Integration and Monitoring
- Integrate the validated ML models into the monitoring tool to enable predictive alerting and proactive scaling.
- Establish monitoring for the ML models themselves to detect model drift and ensure their continued accuracy and effectiveness.
